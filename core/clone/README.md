Â¶ With this [clone](https://github.com/heyprabhat/heyprabhat/tree/master/core/clone) of repository, it can be editable; the files in the preferred editor and the use of "[Git](https://desktop.github.com/)" to keep tracking of your changes without having to be online. It is, however, connected to the remote version so that changes can be synced between the two. You can push your local changes at "localhost" to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.
