# By default, the following paths and files are ignored, so there's no need to add them to .npmignore explicitly:
# .*.swp
# ._*
# .DS_Store
# .git
# .hg
# .npmrc
# .lock-wscript
# .svn
# .wafpickle-*
# config.gypi
# CVS
# npm-debug.log

# The following paths and files are never ignored, so I'm adding them to .npmignore is pointless:
test
.travis.yml
Gruntfile.js
